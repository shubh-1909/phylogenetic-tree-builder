# 🌳 Phylogenetic Tree Builder

This project builds **phylogenetic trees** from aligned DNA sequences using BioPython.

It computes pairwise distance matrices and constructs:
- 🌿 **UPGMA tree** (assumes equal mutation rates)
- 🌳 **Neighbor-Joining (NJ) tree** (flexible, widely used in molecular phylogenetics)

Visualizes relationships as dendrograms, showing evolutionary distances.
